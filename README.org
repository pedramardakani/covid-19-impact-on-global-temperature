* Set-up the CDS API

  First, you need to get your personal API key from the Copernicus website
  as instructed [[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to][here]].

* Install the CDS API python package

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Download the data

  Check the =dataset-api-request.py= file and set it up as you need. For
  example, in this file, we get the data from 1985 up until now.

  If everything is just as you need, execute the file with:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  python3 dataset-api-request.py
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Now wait for the download to finish.
